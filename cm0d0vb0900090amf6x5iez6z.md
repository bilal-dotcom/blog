Protecting your online information is crucial to avoid disastrous consequences. No one is immune to identity theft, loss or leakage of personal or financial data, or unauthorized access. One way to reduce the risk is to ensure a certain level of password security. In this article, we will provide solutions to strengthen the security of your passwords.

### Establishing a Password Convention

Creating a convention for your passwords is an excellent way to ensure they are both strong and <mark>memorable</mark>. The goal is to make passwords as complex as possible while keeping them easy to remember. To do this, it is recommended to use more or less complete phrases: poems, logical (or even illogical) sequences of words, or a specific combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. This method allows you to create robust and hard-to-guess passwords.

### Never Reuse the Same Passwords

Reusing the same password on different sites is an excellent way to cause a massive leak of your information. Note that there are databases created by hackers where all the passwords leaked on the Internet are listed. There are sites like [**HaveIBeenPwned?**](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) or [deHashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) you to check if a site you are registered on has been a victim of data breaches in recent years.

To address this, you should find a way to personalize your password for each site. One trick is to have a sort of <mark>base password</mark> and then find a way to adapt it to each site. This may seem complicated at first, but you just need to find your method. It can be through the name of the site, a color associated with the logo or the name of the site, the shape of the logo, and more. You just need to find the right combination using your convention explained above. Remember, the goal is to remember your passwords.

### Using a Password Manager

The best way to have strong and complex passwords is to use a password manager. It is a tool that will allow you to centralize all your passwords and generate passwords for each of your accounts. There are several options available, such as LastPass, PasswordManager, 1Password, and many others. This option is highly recommended by cybersecurity experts as it simplifies password management while increasing their security.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, password security is essential to protect your online information. By adopting password conventions, avoiding the reuse of the same passwords, and using password managers, you reduce the risk of your data being compromised or made available for malicious purposes.
