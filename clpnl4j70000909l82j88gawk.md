The first step in any penetration test or cyber-attack is reconnaissance. The goal of this phase is to gather as much information as possible about the target system or organization. This information is then used to plan and execute the attack.

There are many tools that penetration testers and hackers use for the reconnaissance phase:

1. **Google**
    
    Google and other search engines should be the first tool for reconnaissance. It can be used to search for any information about the target organization, their employees, clients and partners. It can also be used for leaked data, credentials or any other sensitive information.
    
    1. [Advanced Google Search](https://www.google.ca/advanced_search?hl=fr) : this page allows users to refine their searches with specific criteria and filters to find more accurate and targeted results.
        
    2. [Google Hacking Database (GHDB) - Google Dorks, OSINT](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database): this page is a collection of Google dork that security researchers use for open-source intelligence (OSINT) and reconnaissance purposes. Google dorks are specific search queries that utilize Google's search operators to find information that is not typically accessible through regular searches.
        
    3. [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) : a service offered by Google that allows users to search for images on the web. Users can enter keywords, and phrases, or upload an image to find visually similar images.
        
2. **Shodan**
    
    [Shodan Search Engine](https://www.shodan.io/) : a search engine designed to help users discover devices connected to the internet. Shodan differs from traditional search engines by focusing on collecting data about devices and systems rather than web pages.
    
3. **Maltego**
    
    [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/?utm_source=paterva.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=301) is an open-source intelligence and forensics application. It can be used to identify relationships between people, organizations, domains and other entities. This information can reveal valuable details about the target during reconnaissance. It facilitates the visualization of relationships between different pieces of information.
    
4. **Nmap**
    
    Nmap is a port scanner that can identify open ports and services running on a device or network. During reconnaissance, Nmap can be used to enumerate the target's network topology, discover hosts, and detect vulnerabilities. Nmap is one of the most popular tools for reconnaissance.
    
5. **Who-is**
    
    The [WHOIS](https://whois.domaintools.com/) database is a publicly accessible repository that stores information about domain registrations. It includes details such as the domain owner's contact information, domain registration and expiration dates, domain registrar, and more. This information is often used for administrative and legal purposes.
    
6. **Wireshark**
    
    Wireshark is a network analyzer that can be used for packet sniffing. It allows you to capture network traffic and inspect packets for reconnaissance data.
    
7. **iplocation**
    
    [iplocation](https://www.iplocation.net/) is a website that provides information about the geographical location of an IP address. When you visit the site, it will show your public IP address and location details by default. It uses several GeoIP databases to determine the location based on the IP. The location provided is an approximation and not exact.
    

### Conclusion

In summary, the first tools that should be used during reconnaissance are usually the ones listed above. They provide a wide range of information that lays the foundation for the rest of the penetration test or attack. Other more advanced tools can then be used to gather additional intelligence based on the initial findings. The choice of tools depends on the specific data you need to gather.

Hope this helps! ðŸ™‚
