There are many great Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to choose from when coding. Here are some of the best options I prefer :

* ### Visual Studio Code
    

Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source editor made by Microsoft. It is one of the most popular IDEs among developers due to its simplicity and extensibility. VS Code has the following advantages: built-in Git support

```yaml
- Works on Windows, Mac and Linux 
- Has a clean and simple interface 
- Supports a wide range of languages through extensions
- Has built-in debugging, git integration and a terminal  
- Is highly customizable through themes and keyboard shortcuts
- Built-in Git support
```

* ### IntelliJ IDEA
    

IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful IDE for Java development. It offers the following:

```yaml
- Intelligent code completion  
- Built-in debugger and profiler  
- Refactorings and code analysis  
- Support for many languages beyond Java
- Plugins for additional functionality
```

IntelliJ IDEA is not free but has a community edition that is free to use. But if you are a student or work for some companies, you will have a free access account to all Jetbrains IDEs. With my university email account, for example, I use it for free without paying for a license.

IntelliJ IDEA also has intelligent code completion that suggests relevant classes, methods, and variables based on the context. This helps reduce typos and saves a lot of time.

* ### Eclipse
    

Eclipse offers a comprehensive set of features for Java development. It provides an IDE specifically tailored for Java development with features like:

```yaml
- A Java Editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, code templates
- Project Explorer view to manage Java projects, packages and files.  
- Extensible through plugins
- Refactoring support to rename variables, extract methods, etc
```

So in summary, Eclipse offers a comprehensive IDE for Java development with features that cover editing, navigating, building, debugging and refactoring Java code. The content assist, code templates and formatting further enhance your productivity.

* ### PyCharm
    

PyCharm is an IDE made by the same company that makes IntelliJ IDEA. It is tailored specifically for Python development and offers:

```yaml
- Intelligent code completion  
- Built-in debugger and profiler
- Integration with version control systems   
- Support for web and data science frameworks
```

There is a free community edition of PyCharm but the paid version offers more features.

In summary, the best IDEs to code with depend on your programming language and needs. Personally, my preferred choice is **<mark>IntelliJ IDEA</mark>**. Its exceptional intelligence for code completion, advanced refactoring tools, and extensive support for multiple languages make it a powerful companion for my development journey. Although it is not a free solution, the quality of the features and the increased productivity make it, in my eyes, a worthwhile investment for Java development projects and beyond.
